            <h2>What should come first, houses or museums?</h2>
            <p>Everything at once: the houses, the schools, the museums, the libraries. 
           Urban Planning cannot ignore cultural issues. If in the construction of new neighborhoods, 
           new housing forms the basis of the city plan (and by housing we also mean the market, 
           the schools and the public services like the hospital and the post offices), 
           the planning of a city cannot overlook two key public buildings that still today are considered 
           an intellectual luxury: the Museum and the Library.</p>

            <h2>Museum? What is a museum?</h2>
            <p>In everyday life, when we want to describe a person, thing or idea that is outdated, 
           not practical or useful, we often say 'they belong in a museum'. The expression is a clear 
           indicator of the place museums occupy in contemporary culture, the perception of them as dusty, 
           useless spaces. Sometimes museums are merely the stage for the exhibitionist antics of architects who, 
           rather than designing them to showcase the 'pieces', create complex confections with a decorative character 
           that gets in the way of the 'museology'. <a href="https://archeyes.com/glass-house-lina-bo-bardi/">More information</a></p>
